# The-Battle-of-NeighbourHoods

In this product using numpy and pandas I have discovered different locations in the city of Banglore which have the best percentage of opening a new restaurant based on the areas population,annual income of families,etc.

I downloaded the dataset from the official site of BMC site and a few data sets from Google as well.

According the data, we see that 'Begur,Hulimavu and Kamakshipalya' are top 3 neighborhoods to find similar food to whitefield restaurant's veg food !
My model will recommend top 3 common venues to visit.
